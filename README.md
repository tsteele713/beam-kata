## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Technical Decision making

I chose angular mostly because ive got a fair amount of experience with it and could stand up a new project the quickest that way. I tried to compartmentalize each of the components as much i possible could as well as utilized services where necessary. Likewise, i used karma for the unit tests. I usually opt for using .less files over .css as less files have additional functions that make life easier than plain css.
